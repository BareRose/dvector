## Features

The dvector library provides both common and more specialized 2D/3D vector math operations, its features include:

- No hard dependencies besides the standard library, making it fully portable for most purposes
- Provides vec2, vec3, vec4, quat, mat2, mat3, and mat4 types with various important operations
- Supports an additional frst type along with frustum culling functions for spheres and AABBs
- All dvector types are pass-by-value, allowing for easy use as arguments or return values
